         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44106:18"/> they know not the <hi>Eternal</hi> bleſſedneſs of the life to come, but only that which concerneth this preſent life, their care is only after what they ſhall eat and drink and wherewithal they may be clothed, as our Saviour obſerves, v. 32. <hi>For after all theſe things do the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſeek,</hi> for men that have hope in this life only, it is no marvel if they labour their utmoſt to make their beſt of it, but our Saviour teaches his Hearers to prefer care for things <hi>Eternal</hi> before a care for things <hi>Temporal,</hi> indeed what our Saviour ſayes here is not contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of the Apoſtle in 2 Cor. 8. 21. <hi>Provide for things honeſt,</hi> things that are neceſſary; provide for things neceſſary hath his time; ſo that our Saviour his <hi>primum quaerite regnum Dei,</hi> be firſt remembred. The care for this life preſent and things neceſſary thereunto, is by the Apoſtle commended, but by our Saviour the care of heavenly things is preferred.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch like inſtances we meet with from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Matth. 9. 13. I will have mercy and not Sacrifice;</hi> Chriſt excludeth not Sacrifice, but preferreth Mercy: And <hi>Math. 10. 28. Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both Soul and body in Hell.</hi> Chriſt does not here exclude all reverence and fear to be given unto ſuch, but the meaning is, do not ſo fear them, as you neglect to fear him which hath power to kill both body and ſoul, he preferred the latter before the former. So in my Text, <hi>Chriſt</hi> excludeth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for things neceſſary in this life, but preferreth labour for thoſe things that will endure to <hi>Eternal life.</hi>

They are ſo many golden ſtair-caſes by which our ſouls may climbe above the thickets, and dunghils of this world, as high as Heaven, to view and contemplate the things of <hi>Eternity,</hi> They are as ſo many wings to help the Soul more ſpeedily to approach the preſence of its Creator.

               <p>Now when a Chriſtian improves theſe Ordinances rightly, then he labours for <hi>Eternal good things;</hi> then when he ſearches for theſe things, as <hi>Saul</hi> did for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he ſaid 1 Sam. 23. 23. v. <hi>I will ſearch him out throughout all the thouſands of Judah;</hi> ſo when he ſearches for them through all the Ordinances of the Goſpel, ſearches for them in reading and hearing of the Word Preached; ſearches for them in the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper, &amp;c.</hi> But to come to particulars.</p>

Twice a day was God worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Temple, both morning and evening; twice a day was the Jews conſtant courſe to be in the Temple, there to worſhip God; They had their morning ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice when they went to their labor, and their evening ſacrifice when they ended their labor, they gave God the firſt part of the day and the laſt part of the day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were days appointed for work, they gave the Lord his part of every day; ſo when a Chriſtian though he does follow the work of his particular calling in the day, yet forgets not to labor for what is chiefly to be labored for, as in the morning and firſt part of the day, ſo in the evening and laſt part of the day, he is obeying our Saviour's <hi>Injunction</hi> in the Text.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44106:38"/> What is it tedious to be kept from ſleep one night, and to lye a few hours awake in the dark? O what will it be to lye in torments and darkneſs for ever? I am hear in my houſe upon a ſoft bed in the dark kept (by ſickneſs) from ſleep but one night; O what is it to lye in Flames and Darkneſs for ever, and ever, how dreadful will that be? And theſe thoughts of <hi>Eternity</hi> were the means of breaking this young man off his luſts, that was given to all manner of luſts before.</p>
               <p>Now when a Chriſtian (God driving ſleep from his eyes) does in the night-ſeaſon ſet himſelf to call to mind his ſins, to pray to God, to ſeek for Jeſus Chriſt, to praiſe God, and hath his heart taken up with theſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and his immortal Souls ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, he is about ſuch an imployment as may gain him the poſſeſſion of <hi>Eternal good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a one was <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 22. 2. v. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I cry in the day-time, but thou heareſt not: and in the night-ſeaſon and am not ſilent;</hi> Like one hot in the purſuit of a buſineſs, if he finiſheth it not in the day, he will ſpend the night about it; <hi>David</hi> that prayed three times a day, morning, noon, and night, yea ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a day ſometimes, held on the work in the night. And ſo does the Church expreſs her longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after God, Iſay 26 9. v. <hi>With my Soul have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> It is ſtoried of that <hi>Stoical</hi> Philoſopher <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Zeuo,</hi> a Man who for his exceſſive pains, was called another <hi>Hercules,</hi> while he was poor, on the day-time he ſtudyed Philoſophy, and in the night he got his living by drawing of Water; ſuch another is that Chriſtian who labors after <hi>Eternal happineſs;</hi> after he hath labored in the day, (if God ſhould drive ſleep from his eyes or his ſouls condition
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44106:39"/> requires it) he leaves not off in the night. Like <hi>Seneca</hi> who ſays, <hi>Nullus mihi per otium exit dies partem etiam nectium ſtudijs vendico,</hi> I let no day paſs me idle, ſome part of the night alſo I ſpend in ſtudy, ſo does an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deſiring Chriſtian, when he hath ſpent the day with God and hath been taking pains about <hi>Eternal</hi> concerns of the ſoul, will not be backward to ſpend ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the night, eſpecially if God drive ſleep from his eyes.</p>

               <p>Albeit men can no more merit <hi>Eternal good things</hi> by labour, then a begger by craveing can merit his Alms, yet they are not to expect that theſe things can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without labour and ſtriving, as fleſh and blood will find both hard and difficult to go through.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is compared to fighting of a battel;</hi> the whole life of a Chriſtian, and the whole work of chriſtianity in the concernments of the Soul is ſet forth by and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Scripture unto a fight or battel 2 Tim. 4. 7. <hi>I have fought a good fight.</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p>A Chriſtian hath more then one Enemy to fight and contend with, that labour to hinder his paſſage towards the Promiſed Land, and is ever to look for warrs and bickerings with one or other that is an enemy to his ſouls everlaſting happineſs: here is a Chriſtians warfare, only in Heaven is his Crown; there is no place nor ſtate
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44106:41"/> but Heaven wherein a Chriſtian is free from either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward enemies; there and no where but there is he triumphant, here he is alwayes militant, aſſaulted and fought againſt by many adverſaries that diſquiet, hinder his content, and that would fain for ever over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bim.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſing through the Wilderneſs towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> had many warrs and reſiſtances to hinder them in their march thither, ſo have all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of God deſigned for Heaven whilſt they are in the Wilderneſs of this world; they have the Devil and other both Church and ſoul Enemies without them, and inbread corruptions and luſts within them that fight and make warr againſt their Souls. That as it is ſaid of <hi>Cato,</hi> that he conflicted with manners as <hi>Scipio</hi> did with Enemies; ſo does a Chriſtian conflict and combate with Luſts and corruption, as a Souldier does with his enemies in the field theſe warring againſt his Soul; ſo ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter 1. Pet. 2. 11. Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as Pilgrims and ſtrangers, abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which warr againſt the ſoul.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies of himſelf, Rom. 7. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind;</hi> The Law of his members did warr and fight againſt the Law of his mind, by provoking him to ſin; the Apoſtle ſpeaks it of the regenerate eſtate. Gal. 5. 17. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the spirit, and the spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi> There is a contrariety in the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, there is an oppoſite diſpoſition in the nature of it againſt the ſpirit, and this not at one time of a Chriſtians life, but all the time of his life. As fire and water being put together, never ceaſe ſtriving and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until either the fire be extinguiſhed or the water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44106:41"/> ſo a Chriſtian finds it in his ſpiritual fight and combat with ſin, there is no ceaſing of the fight or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat until one of the combatants be killed and deſtroyed; Now 'tis no little labour to fight a battel with and againſt a potent enemy, as indeed ſin is, an enemy that hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the ſtouteſt warriors, <hi>Quos arma &amp; equi &amp; milites &amp; machinamenta capere non potuerunt, hos pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum vinctos reddidit;</hi> ſuch as armes and horſes and ſouldiers and engines could not overcome, ſin hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Victorious <hi>David</hi> felt the force of ſin in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; <hi>Abraham</hi> that ſubdued thoſe Kings who did plunder <hi>Sodome</hi> and carryed away <hi>Lott</hi> is yet, though the eminenteſt man alive in his age for faith, foiled by unbelief; ſuch inſtances as theſe and many more, (but that I love not to lay open the Saints ſores) would ſhew how potent an enemy ſin is; and you know when men are fighting to get a victory over a potent enemy, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to wreſt a Kingdome or a Countrey out of the hands of a potent enemy, they uſe all the care and all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour poſſible to be uſed; and the like care and labour hath a Chriſtian need to manifeſt, when he conſiders what he fights for; not for his countrey, not for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions, not for liberty, not for wife and children, (though the remembrance of ſuch things animates ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) but he fights for that peace of conſcience which paſſeth all underſtanding, he fights for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> whoſe glory lies at ſtake every day, and ſuffers as often as he is overcome by ſin, he fights for <hi>Eternal life,</hi> and for the everlaſting ſalvation of his immortal ſoul.</p>
               <p>Are not theſe things worth fighting for, laboring and contending for? It is in the fighting of this battel as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid it was in the battel he had once in <hi>Affrica</hi> with the children and partakers of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that in other Battels he was wont to fight for glory, but then and

               <p n="7">7. <hi>From the end wherefore we live; to enjoy Eternal good things</hi> is the end wherefore God gave us life.

Now what is this end? It is to be made capable of <hi>Eternal</hi> Happyneſs, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Glory, capable of an everlaſting injoying of God. This is the end of Man's life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to injoy a life whereof there is no end. It is a good ſaying of one; <hi>Quis alius noſter eſt finis, niſi pervenire ad Regnum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus nullus eſt finis?</hi> What other thing is our end but to come to that Kingdom, whereof there is no end?</p>
               <p>The end of a Chriſtian's life is (not as <hi>Anaxagorus</hi> dreamed of the life of Man, to behold the Heavens, but) to live in heaven; to ſerve God upon earth whilſt

               <p>Queſtionleſs (Chriſtians) the end why God created us, was not for a ſhort ſeaſon and time to remain in the world, there to eat, drink, ſleep, ingender, and then preſently for ever to decay and return to nothing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be pertakers of a moſt high and ineſtimable Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> which is to be given us by God after the Emigration and paſſing out of this life, after our ſouls ſhall be divorced from our bodies.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, you that are earthly <hi>Angels</hi> by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Creation, were placed in this world not to labor and take pains chiefly for temporal good things, but for buſineſs of another nature, and for a far more important affair, and of deareſt conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> by all means poſſible to win and work out glory unto God, and to ſave your immortal Souls, <hi>For what is a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted if he ſhall gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul,</hi> Matth. 16. 26.

The bare opinion of the <hi>Druides</hi> (who taught that the ſoul had a continuance after its ſeperation from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) made many of their followers hardy in great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and abated in moſt, the fear of Death; When a Chriſtian hath labored for, and by his labor obtained what will nouriſh his immortal Soul unto <hi>Eternal</hi> life and be proviſion for it in <hi>Eternal</hi> life, none can expreſs the willing thereof to leave the body; A Chriſtian now looks upon Death to be a valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> a door of hope to gain entrance into <hi>Paradice,</hi> to bring him <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum omnium ademptionem, &amp; bonorum omnium adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> a removal of all things that are evil, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all things that are good, and that not good only for a ſeaſon, but for <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Old <hi>Hilarion</hi> could not but wonder his ſoul ſhould be ſo loath to depart out of his body; and therefore when he lay a dying, it is ſaid of him, he beſpake it in this manner: <hi>Soul get thee out, thou haſt for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ſerved Chriſt, and art thou loath to depart, or afraid of Death;</hi> When a Chriſtian hath husbanded all the time of life for the good of his Soul, and finds it ſtored with grace, and aſſured of glory, he is not afraid or unwilling that his ſoul ſhould leave his body; he hath hope in his death and that makes him to be be willing to ſubmit to death, Pro. 14. 32. v. <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44106:55"/> is driven away in his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi>

               <p>I have done with two of the firſt perticulars I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to ſpeak to, upon this Point; I have ſhewed by way of <hi>Explication</hi> when a man may be ſaid to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for <hi>Eternal good things;</hi> and I have ſhewed by way of <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> That <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are to be labored for. The third perticular propounded, was, to ſpeak ſomething by way of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and here I ſhall ſhew that labor is chiefly to be uſed for and about <hi>Eternal good things.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe eight, and ſay ſomething to that, Good reaſon there is that <hi>Our labor and pains ought chiefly to be imployed not about periſhing but Eternal good things,</hi> Becauſe God hath commanded it; it is charged upon us as a duty, and if we obey not we run our ſelves into a ſpiritual Praemunire: that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God who tells the number of the Starrs calling them by their names, he charges us to do ſo, and if we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him not, we offer an affront to his Soveraingty, as if his will were not reaſon enough for his commands; And to his wiſdom, as if he did not know what Laws were good for us; And to his Juſtice, as if the ways of God were not equal. If any ask me, <hi>Quis requiſivit?</hi> who hath required this at our hands? who requires that our labor ſhould chiefly be about <hi>Eternal good things?</hi> I anſwer, It is the great GOD of Heaven and Earth that by his word made all things, to whom the Winds and Seas obey.</p>
               <p>And it is well we have expreſs commands from God in Scripture for this, elſe the world is full of curious Heads and prophane Hearts to outface and out-wrangle ſuch a Truth, nay any truth indeed which men are labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I wiſh all that do love God and do make it their daily work to labor chiefly for Eternal good things, may be all of the mind of that reverend <hi>Baldaſſar,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it in an Epiſtle unto <hi>Oecolampadius, Veniat, veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at verbum Domini &amp; ſubmittemus illi ſexcenta ſi nobis eſſent colla;</hi> Let but the word of God be urged upon us, and we ſhall not be unwilling to lay down our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lives in obedience thereunto; were this but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and holy temper of Mens hearts, a few Scriptures would ſerve to confirm ſuch truths that Miniſters do preach upon: I ſhall here commend only one unto you, and I think it may be as good as many, tis that in Matt. 6. 33. v. <hi>But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs;</hi> In the firſt place, and with your beſt care and endeavors ſeek after the kingdom of God; that ye may be poſſeſſed and ſeized of it, that ye may have a right and title to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> theſe things before all other good things ſhould be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored for; nay theſe things above all other good things ſhould be labored for. Why? Becauſe a laborious ſtriving for theſe things before all other good things, and above all other good things, is the way that the wiſdom of God hath directed us unto. You ſee our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's command what it is, <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs;</hi> I'll take up the words of God himſelf, the place is that which contains a moſt pathetical Option, wiſh or deſire of our moſt infinitely holy, juſt and righteous God, that would find us in ſuch a way that he may do us good for the preſent, and

                  </hi> v. 29. O that there were ſuch an heart in Chriſtians, that they would fear God and keep his commandments; that they would ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs; And why? The great God of the whole world commands it, and the beſt friend of Chriſtians that ever trod upon the earth (even Chriſt) adviſeth it in my Text, and we may well be aſſured, that the one will reckon for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying his Commands, and the other for ſlighting of his advice and counſel.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous thing to neglect one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands who by another is able to command us into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or into Hell.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44106:59"/> upon his two leggs; an old man, who goes on three, counting his ſtaffe for one: So there be three conditions of Men; the worldly man, who goes upon all four, and looks to earthly things; The Saints in Heaven, who trample theſe things of the world under their feet, going upright and ſcorning ſo much as to look towards them, they need them not at all; But the Saints on earth, though they tread upon them in their eſteem, yet they muſt look a little towards them in their neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be without them: as long as any of us have the old man about us, we cannot go without the ſtaffe of Bread, as long as we abide in the world, we cannot be without ſome things of the world; and even theſe things you ſee are called good things.</p>
               <p>But yet our labor ſhould be chiefly about <hi>Eternal good things;</hi> Becauſe though the things of this life are good, yet <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are the beſt, the chiefeſt and excellenteſt of good things, they are the only things worth the laboring for; many things are hard to come by, and yet of no great uſe or worth when by great labor and pains taking they are gotten or brought to paſs. <hi>Aelians</hi> cenſure of the Chariot (I have read of) made (by <hi>Myrmccidas</hi> and <hi>Callecrates</hi>) ſo ſmall that it might be hid under a Fly, (in my conceit) was good, and applicable to my purpoſe; For when others wondered at it, he ſaid it was worthy no wiſe man's praiſe, but was rather to be accounted a vain expence of time; and how much vain expence of time may be noted amongſt many men laboring for what is not worth the labor uſed to gain them. As ſome more excellent Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of great parts and abilities ſpend their time and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies about very unprofitable Queſtions and Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and intricate ſubtilties about Moon-ſhine in the Water, as one complains, that Spider-like, eviſcerate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44106:59"/> themſelves and ſpend their bowels, to make Cob-webbs of Wit: So a man cannot but have obſerved what time and labor ſome men ſpend in and about ſome things that neither are of advantage to their Souls or their Bodies. But now <hi>Eternal good things</hi> they are indeed hard and difficult to obtain, but will be found to be ſingularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternal good things</hi> to the very beſt of worldly good things are as the Sun to the leaſt of Starrs; as ſome ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pallace, the ſeat or habitation of a great Monarch, to a ſmoaky and thatch'd Cottage the habitation of a Peaſant; they are as Gold to Braſs; <hi>Et melius eſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens aurum quam fulgens aurichalcum,</hi> a little of the paleſt and courſeſt Gold is farr better then much of the fineſt and brighteſt Braſs.</p>
               <p>One Chriſtian's ſhare of <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> is farr better then what all the Kings and Potentates in the world, do injoy of the world: <hi>Hi numeroſè aggrigant penes ſe denſiſſimum lutum,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpeakes chap. 2. 6. v. <hi>Wo to him that increaſeth that which is not his: how long? and to him that ladeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with thick clay.</hi> Theſe are laden with thick clay; <hi>Illi aurum igni exploratum poſſident;</hi> They are inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pure Gold: <hi>Revel, 3. 18. v.</hi> Their <hi>Exchequer</hi> may be full, but tis only the World's counterfeit coyn; the other have the true treaſure. Their Wardropes may be plentifully furniſhed, but tis only with glaſſy Pearl; the other injoy that precious Orient Pearl, which to purchaſe, the wiſe Merchant ſold all.</p>
               <p>There is as much difference between <hi>Temporal good things</hi> and <hi>Eternal good things</hi> as there is between the light of a Candle and the light of the Sun when it ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in its full brightneſs at mad-day: A Candle in a dark-night makes a great ſhew, but the light thereof when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44106:60"/> the Sun cometh, vaniſheth, and is nothing: Even ſuch are all thoſe things, that men now ſo much affect and labor ſo much for, if compared with what will indure to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> the worth of them doth vaniſh and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>What think you of thoſe new inveſtitures of the Soul after the Reſurrection: of thoſe royal endowments of glorified ſouls in Heaven, ſhining there like the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of our Saviour upon Mount <hi>Tabor?</hi>

Well, Chriſtians, yet know that a treaſure which exceeds Gold, as far as Gold does Dirt, precious liquours wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or precious ſtones pebles, is laid up for Believers in Heaven. <hi>Bona vitae aeternae, tam multa ut numerum, tam magna ut menſuran, tam praetioſa ut eſtimation em omnen excedunt:</hi> The good things of <hi>Eternal</hi> life are ſo many that they exceed number, ſo great that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed meaſure, ſo precious that they are above all eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>I deny not but that many things in this world are tranſcendent and raviſhing; but the beſt of them are no better then acceſſories to theſe principals, drops to theſe Oceans, glimps to theſe Suns, and dunghill-felicities to theſe <hi>Eternal</hi> Injoyments; The greateſt pomp and glory of Kings and Emperors is but duſt in compariſon of theſe things.</p>
               <p>It will appear that <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are the beſt Good things.</p>
               <list>

               <p>Now by making good theſe two things, that <hi>Eternal good things</hi> make men good in this world, as well as happy in another world; and alſo that <hi>Eternal good things</hi> will do men good and ſtand them in ſtead when other good things will neither do them good nor ſtand them in ſtead, I hope it will appear that <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are the beſt good things; for ſurely thoſe things may well be called the beſt things that make men good, and that do men good when nothing elſe in the world will do them good; I ſhall begin with the firſt,</p>
               <p>1. It will appear that <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are the beſt good things, <hi>Becauſe only Eternal good things make thoſe who do injoy them to be good:</hi> They make men to be good here in this world, and happy hereafter in another world.</p>
               <p>Even to be converſant about <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> is of great moment to the bettering of the Soul; for look what the object is, ſuch is the ſoul that is converſant about it; high and <hi>Eternal</hi> Objects lift up the ſoul to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44106:62"/> God and towards Heaven, and make the mind anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto them: <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are high Objects, and they will work in men converſant about them high minds, they will draw the mind upward and raiſe it from Earth to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But too oft is it otherwiſe with Temporal things; Gold may make a man the richer, not the better; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor may make a man the higher, not the happier: Says one of our own Land, God hath no worſe ſervants in our land, then they that can live of their own Lands and care for nothing elſe; none are ſo ready and apt to neglect the thoughts and care of Religion and Heaven as thoſe who have moſt upon earth, as being on every hand beſet with temptations to ſin and ſolicitations to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God. That veryly the more any man hath of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things,</hi> the more cauſe he hath to pray, <hi>Lord lead us not into temptation;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have to this purpoſe read it noted out of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that antiently there were two moſt notable Proverbs in prejudice of Rich Men; The firſt, That he who was very rich could not be a good man. The ſecond, That he who was rich, had either been a bad man, or was the Heir of a bad man. Indeed two often Riches and Vice go together; And therefore our Saviour when he taught the <hi>Beatitudes;</hi> he gave the firſt of them to the Poor, Luk. 6. 20. v. <hi>Bleſſed be the poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God;</hi> And in laying down of the <hi>Woes,</hi> he gave the firſt of them to the rich, Luk. 6. 24. v. <hi>But woe unto you that are rich, for ye received your conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> The firſt of the <hi>Beatitudes</hi> is given to the poor and needy; The firſt of the <hi>woes</hi> is given to the rich and ſuch who abounded with the <hi>Temporal good things</hi> of the world. Riches proving two oft not only impediments to Vertue and Piety, but occaſions to Sin; gotten for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44106:62"/> the moſt part they are by ſin, and occaſions they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times afterwards of ſin, and (without Repentance conſequently of <hi>Eternal</hi> Damnation.</p>
               <p>It is an hard matter to have them and not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from Heaven by them, they being fuel to mens Luſts, lets to Prayer and blocks in the ways of Piety and Devotion many times. Matth. 19. 24. <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, then for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> alludes to a proverbial ſpeech among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it was this; When men did brag and boaſt they would do ſtrange works, and great matters, their friends would jeer them with this, you can as ſoon bring a <hi>Camel</hi> through a Needles eye as do it. Now Chriſt in a ſolemn way uſeth this Proverb, (they knowing what he meant) that as it is a thing not eaſie to bring a <hi>Camel</hi> through a Needles eye, ſo it is a thing not eaſie neither to bring a Rich man to the kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>How many have had them, but they got no good by them, they do rather poyſon them then profit them. What kept the Young man from following of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſame Chapter? Great poſſeſſions. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells him at the 21. v. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven: and come and follow me:</hi> but (at the 22. v.) <hi>When the young man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful: for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> (that ſpake as never Man did) perſuaded him to ſell all &amp; come again then to follow him: He was ſo far from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that without any civility or good manners tendred unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Maſter, he rudely and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully departs from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> neither love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor deſire of <hi>Eternal</hi> life could prevail with him to ſtay with <hi>Chriſt</hi> any longer; he was loath to part with his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44106:63"/> great Poſſeſſions, that if Heaven and <hi>Eternal</hi> life be to be had upon no other tearms, <hi>Chriſt</hi> may keep his Heaven to himſelf; He will have none, he will keep his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon earth, for all poſſeſſing of <hi>Eternal</hi> life. How good had it been for this young man that he had never been a Rich man?</p>
               <p>How many do we ſee in the world injoying a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of temporal good things to kick againſt God: Hence that Caution Deut. 6. 10, 11, 12, v. <hi>And it ſhall be when the Lord thy God ſhall have brought thee into the Land which he ſware unto thy Fathers, to</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob <hi>to give thee, great and goodly Cities which thou buildeſt not, And houſes full of all good things, which thou filleſt not, and wells digged, which thou diggeſt not, Vinyards and Olive-trees, which thou planteſt not when thou ſhalt have eaten and be full, Then beware leaſt thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the houſe of Bondage.</hi> And indeed ſo it fell out at the 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. But <hi>Jeſurun</hi> waxed fat and kicked:—nay more, <hi>then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his ſalvation;</hi> His heart was exalted againſt God; though he had in his poſſeſſion Houſes full of good things, yet for want of having his heart filled with Goodneſs, he kicked againſt God; like the young <hi>Mulet,</hi> when it hath ſucked, turns up his heels and kicks at the Damm. Nay that is not all, for he runs from God; like the fed Hawk that forgets his Maſter.</p>
               <p>There are but few <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> in the world, ſome I hope there are that do imitate ſo good a Man; It is ſaid of him, 2 Chron. 17. 5, 6. <hi>That he had riches and honor in abundance, and his heart was lift up in the ways of the Lord;</hi> in the ways of God's commands,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44106:63"/> to do ſuch things as God required and that were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable unto God. The higher God had raiſed <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> in his Eſtate, the lower he kept his Heart in a way of obedience to the God of his Eſtate; the more God had enriched <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> the more <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> ſet himſelf to obey God; what God had given him became as Oyl to the wheels of his obedience, and made him more fit and willing for ſervice.</p>
               <p>But alas! it oft-times proves otherwiſe with very many that injoy much of theſe <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> that they have had cauſe to curſe the time that ever they had an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that ever they had abundance of the good things of this life, they have found them as enchantments to draw away their hearts from God, and as Trumpets ſounding a Retreat, and calling them off from the purſuance of Religion; theſe things are as great weights upon the backs of thouſands, hindering them from aſcending up <hi>the hill of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wealth did him more hurt then his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did him good, it was his fulneſs and abundance that drew out his ſpirits and diſſolved them and brought him to ſuch a low ebb in Spirituals, that it remains a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſome, <hi>Whether he ever recovered it to his dying day.</hi> What a ſad ſtory was that of <hi>Pius Quintus;</hi> When I was in a low condition (ſaid he) I had ſome comfortable hopes of my ſalvation, but when I came to be a Cardinal, I greatly doubted of it, but ſince I came to the Popedom, I have no hope at all. For as it is the miſery of the poor to be neglected of men, ſo it is the miſery of the rich to neglect God, and too oft to neglect the worſhip and ſervice of God; <hi>Rare fumant faelicibus arae,</hi> the Altars of the Rich ſeldom ſmoak.</p>
               <p>But herein now lyeth the excellency of <hi>Eternal good things</hi> above the beſt of <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> that as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44106:64"/> theſe are often found to do hurt to the Owners, ſo the other good things make the owners thereof to be good; not only make them happy in another life; but they make them good here, that they may be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And this will appear by laying down ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Eternal good things</hi> that may be had in this life, all which have in them this Excellent property, to make thoſe who have them to be Good.</p>

Glory with God will be <hi>Eternal,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Grace</hi> from God <hi>Eternal. Grace</hi> and glory differ very little, <hi>Grace</hi> is glory in the bud, and glory is grace at the full; <hi>Grace</hi> is glory in the ſeed, and Glory is grace in the flower. <hi>Grace</hi> is that glory the Saints have in this life which is Militant, and Glory is <hi>Grace</hi> to be had in that life which is Triumphant.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Sin hath made the nature of man which in the time of innocency was holy to become unholy; it hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Righteouſneſs into Hemlock and Wormwood,</hi> as <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael, Amos 6. 12. v.</hi> that was a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed change; but <hi>Grace</hi> turned <hi>Hemlock into righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When the hand of God was out againſt the Church for her ſins, and afflicted her ſore, <hi>Jeremy</hi> complains <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. That her Gold was become Droſs, and her Wine water. This was a change from good to bad, but <hi>Grace</hi> works a quite contrary change, it makes droſs to become gold, and water wine: This is a change from bad to good.</p>
               <p>Though Sin be an impure Iſſue, a befilthying thing, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. yet grace cleanſeth the heart: Grace is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the waſhing of Regeneration. Titus 3. 5. v. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration and renewing of the holy Ghoſt; Grace</hi> cleanſeth out thoſe <hi>Leopard</hi> ſpots that are in the Soul; <hi>Grace</hi> beautifies and adornes the Soul; a Soul beautified with grace, is like a room richly hung with <hi>Arras</hi> or <hi>Tapeſtry,</hi> or the Firmament beſpangled with glittering Starrs.</p>

               <p>But the world methinks is like ſome great Kings court wherein are both great Stateſment and young children, the children are very much taken with pictures, they delight to feed their eyes and fancies with gildings, paintings, hangings and ſuch fine things; but the wiſe and grave Stateſmen paſs by theſe, their buſineſs is with the King; I compare, he greateſt part of men to theſe young children, theſe are wholly taken up with what

When <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour in a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> commanded his Herald to proclaim him with all his Titles, ſtyling him Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Naples, Sicily, &amp;c. Francis</hi> commanded his Herald to call him ſo often King of <hi>France,</hi> as the other had Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles by all his Countries, intimating that <hi>France</hi> alone was more worth then all the Countries which the other had. So when men of the world bragg of their honors, livings, and great Lordſhips; He that can ſay, God is his God, that God is his Portion, he may oppoſe this one God to all Dignities and Poſſeſſions whatſoever; for when a man hath God he hath all; God is bleſſedneſs it ſelf, he is a good in whom there is no evil.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, for he who thus injoys God is made good; God being the ſource, the ſpring, the fountain and original of all that good which is in the Creature; from him comes all that good any of his have received, as the beams from the Sun or water from the Fountain; and from him comes all that good any one can expect hereafter.</p>
               <p>God is good and he does good; ſo he is good and makes all thoſe, who have him for their God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, Good. They who injoy God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are made glorious, thoſe upon earth that have God for their God are made gracious. God is an holy God, and thoſe upon whom he beſtows himſelf in a ſpecial manner, he makes them holy, he ſtamps his Image

               <p>How ſhould this make us to ſhut our eyes to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as if they were not, and look wholly to God, and there make our deſires and labors to terminate as having nothing further to labor, and as deſiring no other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Thus it is to thoſe that have an injoyment of God though they have him alone, nothing beſides him for their portion, yet as he makes them good, ſo he alone is ſufficient to make them happy.</p>
               <p>This is that very thing which hath made thoſe, who have known the truth of this very thing, to be reſtleſs in their ſouls until they have centered themſelves in God and the injoyment of God. All creatures (ſay Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) deſire their Center, and do no where reſt but in their proper places; The ſpark of fire tenders upwards; ſtones they move downwards; The floods and all waters have many turnings and windings, but they never ceaſe until they come into the Sea, that common receptacle of all waters; So the ſoul of man hath its Center, which is God; it never reſts until it be there, and when it injoys God, it would never be removed. <hi>Feciſti nos, Domine, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter te, &amp; in quietum eſt cor noſtrum, donec perveniat ad te,</hi> ſays holy St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Lord thou haſt made us for thy ſelf, and our hearts are unquiet until they be wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall periſh but thou ſhalt endure, yea all of them ſhall wax old like a garment: as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: But thou art the ſame and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us that he it is <hi>who is over all, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. v. <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is <hi>the ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever.

Revel. 1. 8. v. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, ſaith the Lord, which is and which was and which is to come!</hi> The phraſe is known to be taken from the Greek letters, whereof <hi>Alpha</hi> is the firſt, and <hi>Omega</hi> the laſt letter of the Greek Alphabet; The firſt and laſt letters are a deſcription of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was before all, and will be after all, and altogether unchangeable in himſelf. When friends dye, when eſtates are gone, yet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will remain and be a never failing ſpring and fountain of all bleſſings and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth make all them <hi>good</hi> who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him; All men by nature are empty of all ſpiritual <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is as a fountain filling them therewith that poſſeſs him. All men by nature are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; it is true of all men what the Apoſtle faith of the wanton Widdow, 1 Tim. 5. 6. v. <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> As <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi> ſaith the like of a light Huſwife, <hi>Sane hercle homo voluptati obſequens fuit dum vixit.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Greek (as one noteth) cannot well be rendred but by <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> Latin, and <hi>Terences</hi> Latin cannot well be put into other Greek; Here is the true condition of men before they are intereſted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are all as ſo many dead men; they are but walking Sepulchers, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies living Coffings carrying about in them dead ſouls,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44106:71"/> they are all of them ſpiritually dead, they are living ghoſts; thoſe men who be already in their graves are not more devoid of natural life then theſe are of ſpiritual life, they are like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s dead bones until <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> breath life into them; until <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeak to them as once he did to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Come out of the Grave and live, they are ſtark dead. Look what a branch is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a root, or a body without a Soul, ſuch is every man without <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he is but a withered branch or dead carcaſs; <hi>Dead, twice dead and pluckt up by the roots,</hi> ſpiritually dead whilſt corporally alive, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alienated from the life of God whilſt they injoy the life of Men. There is the life of the body, and this life they have, but there is the life of the Soul and that life they have not. We hear of many children born dead, its true in this ſence, all men are born dead men, there is not a man born a member of the new <hi>Adam,</hi> but every man is born a member of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore in a ſpiritual ſence they muſt needs be born dead men, though otherwiſe endued with a natural life. For if the root be dead, as the old <hi>Adam</hi> is, all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that riſe from that root muſt needs be dead alſo. <hi>In Adam all dyed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22. v.

And therefore ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> John 5. 12. v. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> And the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him <hi>Our

Neither faith nor any other ſaving grace dwelleth in ſuch a one, but he is as full of all kind of evil, as <hi>Baal</hi>'s houſe of Idolatry, as the Sluggard's field of thorns and bryars, or as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſepulchers of dead mens bones; ſuch a man's Soul is a very ſink of uncleanneſs and naughtineſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet they are not three Eternals, but one Eternal.</hi> And Eternally bleſſed is that man who hath gotten this Eternal ſpirit of the living God into his heart, for whereſoever the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God comes it is not idle; We read Matth. 8. 7. v. how Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Centurion, When I come I will heal thy ſervant;</hi> I will not meerly come to ſee him and viſit him, <hi>but when I come I will heal him:</hi> So when the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> doth come into a man, he will not be idle and do nothing, but he will heal the Soul, ſanctify the heart, and purge corrupted nature in ſome meaſure. Holyneſs is the natural product of the ſpirit, by its powerful influence and breathings it raiſes poor dead Souls out of the grave of ſin, frames them unto a ſpiritual and divine conformity unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſubdues the rebellion of evil hearts and makes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to become another man by a ſpiritual <hi>Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> This is that work which is aſcribed to the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 2, v. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledg of God the Father, through ſanctification of the ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience; and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus:</hi> Here is held forth the concurrence of the whole <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in the ſalvation of man; The <hi>Father</hi> electing us, the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence it is that our Saviour calleth it the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. v. <hi>If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him? Sanctus dicitur, quia ſanctificat,</hi> He calleth him the holy Spirit, which is to ſanctify, or make holy the hearts of men. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore calleth it <hi>the ſpirit of holyneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. v. And tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> they were ſanctified hereby, 1 Cor. 6. 11. v.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44106:73"/> And again thus he doth ſpeak to the <hi>Theſſalonians, God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth.</hi> The ſpirit is principal in ſtamping the Image of God upon the heart, and ſanctifying the ſoul by Grace here, that he may exalt us to Eternal glory in heaven hereafter.</p>
               <p>Hence we have all our graces and gifts, <hi>Grace</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are ſanctified, whereby the rebellion of our will is ſubdued and the uncleanneſs of our affections purified and we thereby qualified and enable to ſerve God: Hence we have not only our <hi>Graces</hi> but all our <hi>gifts</hi> to qualify and inable us in our ſeveral places and relations to edify one another; 1 Cor. 12. 7. v. <hi>The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi> The gifts of <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> are given for the common good of all the Church, to which only end all ought to be referred. <hi>Non nobis nati ſumus;</hi> we are neither born nor born again for our ſelves.

Ezek. 36. 26. 27. v. <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them;</hi> Such a willing obedience is wrought by the ſpirit when that is made good that you have in the 26. v. <hi>A new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take the ſtony heart out of your fleſh and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> If a man could put a <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> life into a ſtone, what would the ſtone do? it would grow as a plant doth grow: If a man could put a <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> life into a ſtone, what would the ſtone then do? it would ſtirr and move as a worm or beaſt doth: If a man could put a <hi>reaſonable</hi> ſoul into a ſtone, what would the ſtone do? it would talk as a man doth, it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of heavenly matters as a man doth, and purſue the matters of the world as a man doth. But if a man could put the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> and <hi>the ſpirit of Grace</hi> into a ſtone, what then would the ſoul do? it would ſpeak of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of Heaven and Happyneſs, it would purſue ſpiritual and heavenly matters and things. This is every Man's eſtate and condition, as long as there is nothing but the life of reaſon in them, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nothing but the things of the World, they talk of nothing but the world, and they labor after nothing but the <hi>Temporal things</hi> of this world; but if once the ſpirit of God be in them, if once they have gotten the ſpirit of God, it ſtirrs them up to talk of Heaven and to labor after the things of heaven; it works in them holy motions and holy affections. How fruitful in all kind of goodneſs does the ſpirit make thoſe in whoſe

               <p>But what is all the rack, the horror and torment of <hi>Conſcience</hi> in this life, (though it be an hell upon earth) to that everlaſting and immortal ſting of <hi>Conſcience</hi> in Hell; when in Hell to all <hi>Eternity</hi> the ſinner muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the laſhes of <hi>conſcience, Conſcience</hi> making him for ever to remember his ſins committed in this life.

               <p>There is not a perſon upon the face of the Earth that we muſt always live with upon Earth; but with his <hi>Conſcience</hi> a man is always to live with.

               <p>Theſe things being firſt conſidered, we may eaſily find out who is the good man, and alſo who will be the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally</hi> happy man.

And no ſuch a comfort and cordial in times of troubles and afflictions as a good <hi>Conſcience.</hi> It is that which the <hi>Preacher</hi> ſaith of <hi>Money</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 19. <hi>Money anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things;</hi> What ever it is that a man deſireth, if it be to be got, <hi>Money</hi> will procure it for him; <hi>Money</hi> is the <hi>Monarch</hi> of the world and therein bears moſt <hi>Maſtery:</hi> Of <hi>Antipater</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He was a well mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed man, and therefore a very mighty man.</hi> We may truly ſay the ſame of a good <hi>conſcience;</hi> A good <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>

Chriſtians, let me ſay unto you as <hi>Paul</hi> once did to <hi>Agrippa, Do you beleive the Scriptures? I know you do.</hi> And in them theſe truths are plainly and plentifully proved, That <hi>Eternal good things</hi> will do thoſe good who enjoy them, under afflictions, at death, and at judgement. I begin with the firſt of theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Eternal good things will ſtand a Chriſtian in ſtead and do him good when God ſhall lay him under affliction.</hi> Nothing more common indeed then to find the worſt of men in the beſt outward condition, enjoying abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> and liveing in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and free from all kind of afflictions; ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaies of them, <hi>That they are not in trouble as other men, their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, they have more then their hearts can wiſh, but for himſelf all the day long he was plagued and chaſtened every morning.</hi> Pſal. 73. 4. 5. 7. 12, 14. <hi>v.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And as nothing is more common then to find the worſt of men in the beſt outward condition; yet as common it is on the other hand to find the beſt of men in the worſt outward condition; to find them ſuffering Afflictions and to meet them travelling through the Valley of <hi>Bata</hi> as they go towards <hi>Zion,</hi> Pſal. 84. 6. v.

               <p>In outward things God's enemies fair better in this world then his friends, and for any to expect to be wholly freed from affliction is in vain, that is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of none but Saints already in Heaven, even they whilſt on this ſide Heaven were fed with the bread and water of affliction, and tis not for any to expect that God ſhould ſtrow Roſes or ſpread Carpets for their feet only to tread upon in the way to Heaven; that Man is but a <hi>Thiſtle</hi> and no good <hi>corn</hi> that cometh not under the Flayl; a baſtard and no ſon whom God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth not.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44106:90"/> change to a more happy eſtate; So far did meer Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy carry men in the opinion of Felicity; that death was not to be feared in that to good Men it was the way to Felicity; a truth that a Chriſtian may rely upon on better and more certain grounds then a Heathen can; It made <hi>Seneca</hi> imbrace death, ſaying as he bled to death, <hi>Scalpello aperitur ad illam magnam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem via;</hi> his death made but way to a greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; ſo does the good Man, death it makes a way for that which is far better then any thing the world affords; And ſhould it trouble a Chriſtian then to yield to death.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Man's Landlord ſhould turn him out of his houſe, that he and his wife and children muſt lodg in the Streets, would he not willingly ſubmit to that perſon that would remove him out of his preſent habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that poſſibly is but ſome ſmoaky hole, a dark, low and old Cottage, and compaſſed about with bad neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; into a lightſom, large, lofty, laſting houſe, and where he were ſure to have good Neighborhood; Would it not do ſuch a one good to think of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change he is to make? would it not make him willing to remove? ſuch an houſe will ſtand him in ſtead indeed; And is not the believer aſſured of ſuch an houſe? read 2 Cor. 5. 1. v. <hi>For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> The Soul now dwells in the body, which is but as a dark, mean, decaying old Cottage which is compaſſed about with bad neighbors. The Soul finds the body but a dark habitation, dark in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Heaven; As that <hi>Dutch</hi> Divine <hi>Bugenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi> after he had read his book <hi>De Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitate Babylonica,</hi> That <hi>Luther</hi> was in the light but

               <p>The body is but a mean habitation for the ſoul which is of a ſpiritual and immortal ſubſtance to dwell in <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> calls it an houſe of clay; St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place laſt named, calls it an Earthly houſe; <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it nothing but <hi>Duſt, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. v, it is but a <hi>vile body Phil. 3. 21. v.</hi> Tis but (as one ſays) a clay wall encompaſſing a treaſure; or a courſe caſe of a rich Inſtrument.</p>

               <p>Is the body a dark houſe? Heaven is a light ſom houſe; hence it is ſet forth by the name of Light. Col. 1. 12. <hi>Saints in Light;</hi> that is, in the glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. God is there ſaid to dwell in an unapproachable light; there is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Day without Night; <hi>there is no night there,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, Rev. 21, 25. v.</hi> Though ſome regions that lye immediately under the <hi>Pole</hi> have light for ſeveral Months together, yet when the Sun withdraws from their Horizon, they have as long a night and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as before they had a day; but ſays St. <hi>John, There ſhall be no night there,</hi> no darkneſs there.</p>
               <p>Is the body but a mean habitation for the Soul to dwell in? Heaven is a moſt glorious habitation. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> beholding the magnificency of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Quomodo caeleſtis Jeruſalem ſi ſic fulget terreſtris Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> What an habitation hath God prepared for a Nation that love holyneſs and truth, if he have ſuch things as theſe for them that love Vanity? What was the Temple built by <hi>Solomon</hi> for the Lord to this coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Paradiſe prepared by the Lord? What are the Courts of the greateſt Emperors to the Court of the great God? what are the ſtatelieſt Fabricks in the world, if compared with this Eternal houſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Is the body a ruinous houſe that will ſhortly moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into duſt? Heaven is an everlaſting habitation; It is called ſo Luk. 16. 9. v. <hi>They may receive you into everlaſting habitations;</hi> ſo is Heaven called in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Earthly dwellings, which though many of them are beautiful and glorious, yet ſhall be laid in the duſt. Many houſes here below may be laſting, but not ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, but this runs parallel with Eeternity. The firſt ſeat of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44106:91"/> without doubt very glorious, but not permanent, not <hi>Eternal,</hi> this is far better, more glorious and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Does the Soul find its preſent dwelling compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with bad Neighbors? In Heaven there is good, very good neighborhood. It is related of <hi>Cato</hi> an old <hi>Roman</hi> that he adviſed in the purchaſe of a Farme or Houſe, that a man ſhould conſider of the vicinity or neighborhood there; <hi>Ne malum vicinum haberet;</hi> And to that purpoſe is related the proclamation of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> a famous <hi>Athonian</hi> Captain, in the ſale of his Lands, that, if any man would deal with him he ſhould be ſure of a good neighbor. There is (if I may have leave to ſay ſo) good neighborhood in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is God our Father, he that begot us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain lives in Heaven. There is <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſitting at the right hand of God in Heaven. All the Saints departed, are now inhabitants of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is Heaven.</p>
               <p>And now, Chriſtians, will it not do a man good that hath a good title to this <hi>houſe not made with hands Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens,</hi> when he comes to dye, and his ſoul muſt be removed out of his clay Cottage. Death to him will be but a bridg from Wo to <hi>Glory;</hi> a paſſage out of a Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan;</hi> the end of his miſery and the beginning of his felicity; the concluſion of his labor and the ſettling himſelf to reſt; though death may be a wicked man's fear, yet it will be his wiſh; though it be the others ſhipwrack, yet it will be his entering into harbor; though it be the others remove from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Hell,</hi> yet will it be his remove from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> To him death will be gain, to the other, death will be a loſs; Death to the wicked man will be a dark and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſage unto the ſecond death and utter Darkneſs,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44106:92"/> but to him an entrance into <hi>Eternal life</hi> and an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light.

               <p>When <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperor was upon his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bed, among all his victories only one comforted him and did him good, and that was victory over his worſt enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> his own naughty heart; So this one thing is enough to comfort a believer and do him good upon his dying bed, That having faithfully all his days labored for <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> now that he muſt dye, yet his eyes will be no ſooner off theſe temporal things, but they ſhall behold <hi>Eternal</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and the ſame minute that ſhuts his eyes ſhall again open them to behold God, and as it determines his miſery, ſo it ſhall begin his happyneſs and feoffe him in that glory which he cannot but for ever injoy. This made holy <hi>Baſil</hi> ſo reſolute in his anſwer to <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the Emperor's Lieutenant when he threatened him with death; <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a benefit to me, it will ſend me ſooner to God, to whom I live, to whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haſten.</hi> This made that <hi>noble army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> mentioned in Eccleſiactical Hiſtory ſuch Lambs in ſuffering, that their perſecutors were more weary with ſtriking, then they with ſuffering; This made them ſlight the ſentence of death, go cheerfully to the ſtake, and leap into beds of Flames as if they had been beds of Down, and to ſuffer the moſt exquiſite deaths and torments that ever the wit or malice of men or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels could invent or inflict upon them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Epicures, Atheiſts,</hi> and thoſe debauched ones that now <hi>Hector</hi> it out ſo ſtoutly in the world, and brave it in a way of all manner of Voluptuouſneſs both in deſpite of God and men, theſe would be glad if death were <hi>ultima linea rerum,</hi> the laſt line of all things, that when they dye and lye down in their graves there might be no Reſurrection; As <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the Grave <hi>a long home,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 5. v. they could wiſh it were rather an everlaſting home; and that the grave might never give <hi>up her dead,</hi> Rev. 20. 13. v. But as death is a ſleep, ſo it might be an Eternal ſleep, &amp; that there never might be any more Evigilation or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of ſleep.

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:44106:93"/>
               <p>This day will be the greateſt for terror to thoſe who never poſſeſſed more then this world, but the greateſt for joy to thoſe who, not contented with this world, had their hearts taken up with the great things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; When the greateſt part of the world ſhall be ſent trembling to Hell, being doomed to everlaſting Flames, and for ever to remain in the ſame condition of the Divels themſelves, then they ſhall go trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phingly to Heaven, be actually ſtated in an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy condition, and for ever delivered from their fears and doubts of Salvation, which all their lives<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were a grievous burthen unto them.</p>
               <p>Terrible will this laſt day be to all thoſe who never looked after providing for the Soul's welfare; but it will be a joyful day to thoſe who have laid up treaſures in Heaven, whither both Soul and body (thoſe two old companions are joyfully haſtening together.

Time was when ſin had changed their ſouls from their Original beauty and glory, had changed them from their primitive excellency and holyneſs, their natures were then altogether ſinful, but at their converſion Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was turned into Grace, and now at their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto Judgment, thoſe who had here gracious ſouls, will then have as glorious ſouls ſo glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; Then their ſouls ſhall be wholly freed from all ſins and corruptions and brought to their primitive beauty and comlineſs; and their bodies from mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and all ſinful uncleanneſs that they may by Chriſt <hi>be faſhioned like unto his glorious body;</hi> It was a rare

               <p>As the Inhabitants of <hi>Samaria</hi> once ſaid, Iſay 9. 10. v. <hi>The Sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars;</hi> the <hi>Sycomore</hi> is but a mean deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tree to the <hi>Cedar;</hi> the bodies of the beſt are but vile and deſpicable bodies now, but at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhall be changed into glorious bodies.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44106:94"/> put on a new freſh ſuit of fleſh, richly laid and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with glory, ſays an ingenious perſon. So much good will Grace do us then and ſtand us in ſtead then.</p>
               <p>Then to have an intereſt in God, the God of all grace, will alſo do us good and ſtand us in ſtead; then thoſe, who have gotten God for to be their God in Covenant with them, will find their intereſt in God to do them good. though God will then be a conſuming fire to burn up ſouls like ſtuble that had not God for their God, yet thoſe who have this intrereſt in God, they may look upon him, not as an enemy that will ſet himſelf againſt them, but as a friend that is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto them; not as an angry Judg that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, but as a merciful Father that willingly hath pardoned them; they may behold him not as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with dread and terror, but with mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; though then God will frown upon them who never labored to get an intereſt in him, yet will he turn away his anger from them who have choſen him for their God, and will behold them with a ſmiling countenance.</p>
               <p>Moſt men highly value an Intereſt in great perſons, and too many value this more then to have an intereſt in a great God; But experience ſhews how mutable the friendſhip of men is, they are like weathercocks upon Steeples that turn with every wind; ſomtimes in their friendſhip they are like the Sun in its full ſtrength, but anon ſome cloud of a ſmall or imagined offence darkens all their love; and nothing is more common then to find friends dying oftentimes one to another, even whilſt they live, and their ſomtimes injoyed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then does them no good nor ſtands them in ſtead, whatever be their ſtraits they come into. But when once a Chriſtian hath gotten an intereſt in God, God
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44106:94"/> will be a God to him as long as he is God; God is a God for ever, and he will be his God for ever. What God is, he was from Eternity, and what God is to any he will be to Eternity, there ſhall never come the time when God will withdraw his love, or his good will ceaſe towards them. He will always do them good, and always ſtand them in ſtead, both in life and death, and the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>God that hath done them good and ſtood them in their greateſt ſtraits of this life will do as much for them at this day. An Intereſt in God did ſtand <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in ſtead when he was in that great ſtrait at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> the City was burnt by the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> in his abſence, his wives carryed captive, the people ready to ſtone him, but <hi>David</hi> he <hi>incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God:</hi> So Pſal. 31. 14. v. there alſo this man, who was a man after God's own heart, is in a great calamity and trouble, but an intereſt in God did him good and ſtood him in ſtead then, For ſays he, <hi>I truſted in thee O Lord, I ſaid thou art my God.</hi> God will have them to know that they have not any cauſe to fear nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed whereſoever they are or whatſoever condition they lye under, ſo long as they have him to be their God. Iſay 41. 10. v. <hi>Fear thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44106:95"/> is in God ſhall be as truly that man's for his good, as it is God's for his own glory. God will do that man good not only whilſt he lives but when he dyes; for God is not his God only while he lived, but when dead; he is his God to do him good at death, and to do him good at Judgment.

               <p>There is a generation of men whoſe names are <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the earth,</hi> as the Prophet hath the phraſe, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. 17. 13. v. <hi>called the Inhabitants of the earth, Rev. 12. 12. v.</hi> in oppoſition to the Saints and heirs of heaven; Men that may with the <hi>Athenians</hi> give the <hi>Graſs-hopper</hi> for their Badge a creature that is bred, liveth and dyeth in the ſame ground; a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that though ſhe hath wings, yet flyeth not, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe hoppeth up a little, but falleth to the ground again; but naturally liveth and dyeth on the ground: So theſe <hi>Terrigenae fratres,</hi> as one calls them, they are bred upon the earth, they live and dye on the ſame earth, and they naturally mind only the things of the earth, and their affections can no more aſcend heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than a worm can fly upwards like a <hi>Lark.</hi> Hence that command directing us about the Object we are to place our affections upon, Col. 3. 2. v. <hi>Set your affections upon things above, not upon things on the earth;</hi> the object preſcribed them, they are to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Things above,</hi> heavenly things, things that will out laſt the days of heaven, and run parallel with the life of God, and line of <hi>Eternity.</hi> The Command implyeth that our affections are before converſion, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally placed other where than they ſhould be, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon earthly things and fading objects.

               <p>It is moſt true that a well grounded hope for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Eternal ſalvation is gotten by, and grounded upon the Word of God; hence it is called the <hi>Hope of the Goſpel,</hi> Col. 1. 23. v. becauſe it is gotten by the Goſpel and grounded upon the Goſpel. All a Saints hopes comes from the Scriptures; Pſal. 119. 49. v. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord wherein thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> Rom. 15. 4. v. <hi>That we</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through the comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might have hope.</hi> And the promiſes of the Scripture are the Anchor of a Chriſtian's hope; that hope which any one hath of Heaven, if not founded upon a promiſe, it may rather be called preſumption then hope.</p>
               <p>Promiſes are the ſureſt Pillars to build our hopes for Heaven upon; when that hope which is not built upon a promiſe ſhall ſuffer ſhip-wrack, then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe will be as a planck upon which we may ſwim ſafe to the ſhoar of Heaven; then a promiſe will be as a <hi>Fiery Chariot to carry us up to heaven.</hi> Heaven is nothing elſe but the enjoyment of the promiſes, Heb. 6. 12. v. <hi>Be followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes;</hi> that is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsam illam haereditatem;</hi> the promiſed Inheritance.

               <p>Many <hi>fooliſh</hi> men are like the want on <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> that leaps and skips, chirps and ſings all the time of Summer, and when the time of the Winter comes, it periſheth for want of what might have been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Summer: O ſuch are too many, they eat and drink, they laugh and ſing, they ſpend their dayes in ſinful delights all the dayes of their life, and entering upon <hi>Eternity,</hi> they <hi>Eternally</hi> periſh for want of what might have been gotten in the time of life.

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was a wiſe man and ſo eſteemed and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of God, becauſe he deſpiſed the pleaſures of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, having an eye to the <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> Hebr. 11. 24, 25, 26. v. That is, becauſe he deſpiſed all the preſent arguments of delight and contentment, and preferred thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which he knew ſhould be infinitely greater, as well as he knew they ſhould be all.</p>

               <p>Such a fool was that miſerably miſtaken rich man in the Goſpel, who (though by himſelf or others judged wiſe) in the account of the only wiſe God was a very fool; why? for he provided only for the time of this life, for many years only to be ſpent in the world, but provided nothing at all for death, or for his Soul after death.</p>

Thoſe who are not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſe, wiſe to that which is good, though the wiſeſt Polititians upon Earth, though they be the moſt ample and cunning <hi>Machiavilians</hi> that live; though they be Doctors in that deep reaching Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, yet are they like fools, being ſharp-eyed like the <hi>Eagle</hi> only in the things of the Earth, but as blind as <hi>Beetles</hi> in the things of Heaven. Wiſe it is true they are, but it is with ſuch a wiſdom as (like the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> wings) makes them out-run others upon Earth and in purſuit of Earthly things, but helps them never a whit towards Heaven or to purſue Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>
               <p>Every one will cry him up for a <hi>fool,</hi> who rather choſe to ſtay in the Theatre, and ſee the ſports out, then quit the preſent ſpectacle, though he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given him to be adopted into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Family.

               <p>This very conſideration ſhould make all men to ſet an high rate and price upon <hi>Eternal good things;</hi> this ſhould attract their hearts and draw them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after them chiefly and above all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and to overlook all the greateſt and beſt things of this life as empty and void of what men expect to be in them, and that ſhould make the ſoul <hi>Eternally</hi> happy.</p>

               <p>If men had no other life to live but this here in this world, then they might content themſelves only with the things of this life, but they have an everlaſting life, therefore ſhould they make ſome proviſion anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereunto; not providing only for this life which is but a ſpan long, and neglect another life that is ſo ſpacious, We muſt all live for ever, 1 <hi>John 2. 17. v.</hi> And truly theſe thoughts of <hi>Eternity</hi> ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing thoughts, and over-awing thoughts.</p>

Eternity</hi> is that (<hi>unum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum hodie</hi>) one perpetual day which ſhall never have end; and therefore the old <hi>Romans</hi> were out, that thought <hi>Eternity</hi> dwelt in ſtatues and Marble Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And it is as true, that we ſhall never in this life, know the worth and preciouſneſs of things that are <hi>Eternal;</hi> it ſhould yet be a Chriſtian's care and labour, to read ſuch books as handle <hi>Eternity,</hi> and things that are <hi>Eternal.</hi> The little knowledge that all ſorts of perſons have of <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Eternal things,</hi> is the main cauſe why they ſo much eſteem the good things of this life, and undervalue the good things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; they are things excellent in themſelves, but how many do not ſo much as know their excellency.</p>
               <p>Here is the very reaſon, that when men are preſſed to labour after <hi>eternal good things</hi> and provide for <hi>Eternity,</hi> they know not what theſe things are, and therefore they take no pains about them.</p>

               <p>Faith is a ſure Proſpective-glaſs, by help where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Soul may ſee things though afar off: Did you never obſerve an eye uſing a Proſpective-glaſs, for the diſcovering and approximating of ſome remote and yet deſirable Object?

Luk. 17. 22: v. <hi>And he ſaid unto the Diſciples; The dayes will come when ye ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee one of the dayes of the Son of man, and ye ſhall not ſee it.</hi> It is true, as God, he was before all dayes, before all time, having neither beginning of dayes nor end of life, as is ſaid of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Heb. 7. 3. v. <hi>Before the day was, I am he.</hi> But as man he hath many dayes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lords day</hi> is his day: Rev. 1. 10. v. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As man he is called Lord of the Sabbath day.

               </p>
               <p>The time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s preaching here on Earth is called <hi>Chriſt's</hi> day, and thus underſtand that <hi>Luke 17. 22. v.</hi> before mentioned, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells them they ſhould <hi>deſire to ſee one of the dayes of the Son of man;</hi> that is, After <hi>Chriſt</hi> was departed out of the world, they ſhould deſire his bodily preſence here with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to comfort them. So alſo the day of <hi>Christ</hi>'s birth, may, and is called, his day, in the place before mentioned, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the great queſtion will be this, how <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſee this day of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s birth It is clear in the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44106:182" rendition="simple:additions"/> words, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had his deſire granted, He did ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s day, he ſaw it though it were two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before it came to paſs. But how ſaw he this day of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s birth? It was <hi>oculis animi,</hi> ſays <hi>Piſcator,</hi> by the piercing eye of his Faith. It is moſt true that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw not the day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Shepheards</hi> and <hi>wiſemen</hi> of the Eaſt ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Manger at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the one being ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Angel, and the other guided by a Star, that they might ſee and behold <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nor did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſee the day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Temple at his Mothers Purification. Nor as <hi>Zacheus</hi> who had a ſight of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the top of a <hi>Sycamoor-tree,</hi> being climbed up thither to get a ſight of him. But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw it <hi>luce fidei,</hi> by the ſight of Faith. Faith helped <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to ſee his day, as clearly as he was ſeen by the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards</hi> or <hi>Wiſe men</hi> of the Eaſt, as clearly as he was ſeen by <hi>Simeon</hi> or <hi>Zacheus;</hi> and this two thouſand years before it came.</p>
               <p>And as Faith can diſcover and approximate things remote in reſpect of time. ſo things remote in reſpect of place: It is ſaid therefore, <hi>That Faith is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. v. by it may be ſeen what is afar off: Some write of one <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi> that he could ſee an hundred and thirty thouſand paces off, but the eye of Faith can ſee further. The eye of the <hi>Eagle</hi> is very ſharp and piercing, ſhe can ſee from Heaven to Earth, ſhe can ſpy her prey afar off, ſhe and her Birds can look upon the Sun: Faith is ſuch an excellent eye; it can ſee him who to the eye of the body is inviſible, <hi>By Faith Moſes ſaw him who is inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11. 27. v. God is inviſible to any eye but to the eye of Faith. And as God is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44106:182" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, a being that no natural eye ever ſaw or can be that way ſeen; ſo alſo are all the <hi>Eternal good things</hi> of Heaven; ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 18. v. he ſayes that things that are <hi>Eternal, are not ſeen:</hi> But in the very ſame Verſe he ſayes, that <hi>we look at things that are not ſeen;</hi> Though they be things that are not ſeen, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and other Believers, that by the eye of Faith they could ſee them, they could by the eye of Faith ſee <hi>Eternal things: While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the things which are ſeen, are Temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are Eternal.</hi> In which words, it is obſervable, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That he and other Believers look at the things which are not ſeen, and thoſe things not ſeen that they look at, are <hi>Eternal;</hi> they are good things that are <hi>Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And without doubt ſuch a ſight as the Apoſtle here means, cannot but work very much upon the heart of a Chriſtian. A ſight of the day of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith greatly rejoyced the good old Patriarchs heart. It even raviſhed his heart to hear the wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to foreſee the joyful performance which he ſaw would follow in due time. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>Perplexed, but not in deſpair,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 8. v. he is <hi>Caſt down but not deſtroyed,</hi> 9. v. he <hi>faints not,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Though our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day,</hi> 16. v. And the reaſon of all is laid down at the 18. v. <hi>While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen;</hi> And theſe things <hi>which are not ſeen are Eternal.</hi> In like manner ſuch a ſight would work ſignally upon our hearts; if we could by the eye of Faith but have a ſight of <hi>Eternal
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44106:183"/> good things,</hi> it would make us long until we come to the fingering and poſſeſſing of them, till we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſeizin of them. Such a ſight would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our hearts with love to them, it would make us like a Suitor or Lover, who is not ſatisfied, who is willing to do any thing and take any pains that he may enjoy his deſired Object. He that gets this ſight will certainly find his affections ſetled upon them, and having his affections ſetled upon, his heart will be ſet to take pains to gain them. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> had ſeen <hi>Dalilah</hi> he loved her, loving her he could not be at reſt until he enjoyed her. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had once ſeen <hi>Rachel</hi> he loved her, loving her he was contented to labour and take pains the ſpace of two hard Apprentiſhips, that he might poſſeſs her.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In labouring for <hi>Eternal good things</hi> labour <hi>faithfully,</hi> let there be ſincerity in uſing all thoſe means whereby <hi>Eternal good things</hi> are to be gain'd; take heed in the uſe thereof that there be no ſquinting aſide at any thing elſe. Verily not every one that uſeth thoſe means, are labouring after <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> but may have their eye rather upon <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good things;</hi> like the <hi>Monk</hi> in the Story, who looked downwards towards the Earth like a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Perſon, but 'twas only to find the keys of the <hi>Abbey:</hi> The <hi>Monk</hi> indeed ſeems to have been a moſt mortified man, and dead to all theſe things of the World, and to have minded things above: Even ſo do many others; how attentive are they in hearing of the Word of God? how often are they reading of the Scriptures? how earneſt are they in praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? how frequent in eating Sacramentally the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Lord's Supper? But alas their hearts are not upright for God, not any delight in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not any love to God's wayes, not any hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring deſire after <hi>Eternal good things</hi> moves them; but they are conſcious to themſelves that there is ſomething elſe which doth ſet them upon this work; and that notwithſtanding all they do, they are not faithful in theſe and the like holy obſervances. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thouſands there are who will hereafter bewail ſuch kind of labour and pains taking. When Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Woolſey</hi> was caſt out of his Princes favour, and left to his enemies fury, ſaid he, <hi>If I had ſerved my God, as faithfully as I have ſerved my King, he would not have left me thus.</hi> And will not thoſe men ſay ſo, when they come into Hell, that have been as
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44106:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> you call them true drudges to the World, but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical in all their ſeeming labour for Heaven and the things thereof; If we had as faithfully laboured after <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> as we did after <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> we had not been left under <hi>Eternal</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery thus.</p>
               <p>I would diſcourage none from hearing, reading, and Sacramentally feeding on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood in the Lords Supper; he that will have <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good things</hi> muſt make uſe thereof, but in uſing ſuch means the heart is all, <hi>Quicquid cor non facit, non fit;</hi> that which the heart doth not, is not done. 'Tis but loytering and not labouring where the heart doth not labour and is not imployed. God he jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of mens doings by what their hearts do, it is the heart that maketh labour herein, good or bad. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 2. v. What he did was in hypocriſie, his heart was not faithful unto God, though he did what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God. It is not enough to do what God wills to be done, but we muſt do the ſame as God wills it ſhould be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In labouring for <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> labour <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,</hi> laying aſide all ſluggiſhneſs of Spirit, that moſt men in the World are guilty of, who go but a Snails pace in the way to Heaven, whereas they can run as faſt as <hi>Dromedaries</hi> in the wayes of the world; <hi>diligence</hi> is required in every mans undertaking and in every mans calling; how active and <hi>diligent</hi> are ſome men, that will loſe nothing for want of looking for, <hi>diligently</hi> husbanding all opportunities of thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and growing rich. How <hi>diligently</hi> did <hi>Boaz</hi> himſelf follow the buſineſs of husbandry; you will

Chapters. As knowing the truth of that Proverbial ſpeech, <hi>Procul a villa diſſitus, jacturae vicinus.</hi> He that is far from his buſineſs is not far from loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diligence</hi> is required in all matters concerning the Body here upon Earth, therefore much more ſhould men put forth <hi>diligence</hi> in all matters concerning the Soul in Heaven, Eccleſ. 9. 10. v. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi> And we read (Pſal. 127. 2. v.) of men that <hi>Riſe up early and go to bedlate, and eat the bread of carefulneſs,</hi> and all for ſomething here in the World to ſuſtain the Body. If we muſt put forth ſo much <hi>diligence,</hi> and uſe ſo much care, that the Body may have whereupon to live whilſt here, ſurely much more muſt we uſe <hi>diligence,</hi> that the Soul may have whereupon to live hereafter. The So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Wiſe man's words are pertinent, Pro. 10. 4. v. <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> I am ſure the hand of a <hi>diligent</hi> Chriſtian w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We ought alwayes to uſe the greateſt diligence about the beſt things, about matters of greateſt concernment, 2 Pet. 3. 14. v. <hi>Wherefore, Beloved, ſeeing that we look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi> And in 2 Pet. 1. 10. v. <hi>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44106:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> to make your calling and election ſure:</hi> The word in Greek is emphatical, and ſignifies to do a thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, not <hi>agere,</hi> but <hi>ſat agere,</hi> not in an overly and careleſs way, but to do a thing with induſtry, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and unweariedneſs of Spirit: And the <hi>diligence</hi> required is in matters of the Soul, herein, <hi>diligence</hi> is to be manifeſted rather then in other matters, hence the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> Do this before all other things in the World; do this rather then all other things in the World; St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes a compariſon between this duty and all other duties, and wills a Chriſtian to lay out his ſweat and induſtry, his labour and diligence, rather about this then any other; as if all other things, in compariſon of this, were to be neglected. In this Channel ſhould run (as it were) the whole ſtream of a Chriſtian's <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44106:186"/> ſee a ſervant continually ſad and dejected, hear him murmuring and complaining, we muſt needs think that he either loves not his Maſter, or likes not his worke, or fears his pay. Such a ſervant diſcredits his Maſters ſervice, and ſuch a Chriſtian alſo diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Religion, as if he were like to gain nothing by all his Religious labour and pains.</p>
               <p>As <hi>God loveth a cheerful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 7, v. ſo God loveth a cheerful Labourer; that in <hi>Pſal. 100. 2. v.</hi> may be a command, as well as advice, <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſs, come before his preſence with ſinging.</hi> As St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>if any be merry let him ſing Pſalmes:</hi> ſo I ſay, if any ſing Pſalmes, read the word, pray or do any other commanded duty, let him be merry. The Apoſtle did <hi>take pleaſure in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſt ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10. v. He did not only ſubmit to God's dealings, but rejoyced in them; ſo ſhould every Chriſtian not only ſet about this labour, but he ſhould rejoyce in it; his Soul ſhould make him like the Chariot of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> and a love to <hi>Eternal good things</hi> ſhould Oyl the wheel of his affections, he ſhould go through his work, as the Plowman goes through his drudging work, whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſinging, imitating our bleſſed Saviour, who delighted to do his fathers will, it was to him meat and drink, as he ſaid to his Diſciples at the Well of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4. 34. v. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his work. Chriſt's</hi> delight in gaining ſouls and bringing them to the knowledge of the Goſpel took his mind off bodily food and refreſhment, even when he had need thereof, the delight he took herein allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſenſe of his outward neceſſities, and was more
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:44106:186"/> refreſhing to him then meat and drink could be, it made him to forget his meat, and it was as meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he took more delight in this worke then an hungry man could take in meat. As <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant would not eat, till he had diſpatcht his errand, <hi>Gen. 24. 33. v.</hi> he preferred his work before his food, it was more content to him to diſpatch the work his Maſter ſent him about, then to be eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>But that I muſt draw to a concluſion, here might be laid down many particulars to ſhew what reaſon a Chriſtian hath to be chearful in this his labour. For Firſt he hath good company with him, and that will make men cheerful, though their labour ſhould be a little more then ordinarily difficult and tedious. Moſt men will be merry in good company, if ever they will be merry; and herein a Chriſtian hath the company of the <hi>Eternal Trinity</hi> and the immortal <hi>Angels.</hi> Secondly, He is certain to be a great gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by his labour; he is not called upon to labour, like a Captive or a Galley ſlave, for nothing; God hath made promiſes to him of good Rewards; he hath promiſed a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. v. a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. v. Such a <hi>Crown of Life</hi> as is a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 4. v. and ſuch a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> as is everlaſting; an <hi>Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. v. All which are ſuch things as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a lame man walk, and a broken arm to bear a burden. Thirdly, he is aſſured of a future and <hi>Eternal</hi> reſt after the labour of this life ended. It is not with a Chriſtian, as it is with an <hi>Ox,</hi> that when he can labour no longer, is carryed to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ceaſeth to be; but he lives for ever, yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

Fourthly, his work, while he labours as he ſhould for theſe things, is accepted; it is no ſmall trouble to a man both in and for the doing of any thing, when the perſon by whom he is imployed, accepts not of what he does; as the contrary muſt needs be a great cheering, Eccleſ. 9. 7. v. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works.</hi> Fifthly, he hath good help and aſſiſtance; he is aſſiſted herein <hi>auxilio ſpiritus</hi> by <hi>the help of the ſpirit,</hi> and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes all a Chriſtians labour, work, and duties eaſy. Heaven is promiſed unto him to encourage him, and make him willing to labour, and the ſpirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him to aſſiſt him and make him able; not any one will much complain what ever his work is, who hath power and affections too.

                  </gap> both to will and to do. Sixthly, His labour is <hi>eaſy,</hi> it is ſo if we will beleive either the teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the teſtimony of St. <hi>John,</hi> both the Maſter and the Diſciple give their teſtimonies hereunto, we have the teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Matt. 11. 30. v. <hi>My yoak is eaſy and my burden is light.</hi> Sin layes an heavy yoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44106:187"/> men, and therefore Sin is compared to a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Lead,</hi> Zach. 5. 7. v. to ſhew the weightineſs of it; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us his <hi>yoak is eaſy;</hi> the yoak that was eaſy ſo long ago when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid it, cannot be grown uneaſy with wearing; for the longer any thing is worn, the eaſier that thing is to wear. We have the teſtimony of St. <hi>John</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. v. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous.</hi> As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake what he well knew, ſo queſtionleſs St. <hi>John</hi> ſpake what he by experience had found to be true. Indeed to labour for theſe things may be irkſome and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him that is unwilling and would not labour, that would not at <hi>all ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate</hi> or climb up the Hill; or it may at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it appear ſo unto one that never ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to labour; or it may be ſo to one that loves not any kind of labour, for as love will make any kind of labour delectable, want of love makes it burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Or, Laſtly, it may be ſo even to the carnal, fleſhly and unregenerate part of a beleiver, for in ſuch there is a <hi>Law in the members which rebells againſt the Lawes</hi> of Heaven: but to the regenerated part of a Chriſtian, it is not irkſome but delightful, it is not difficult but eaſy. It is certainly eaſier then ſin in the midſt of all its pleaſures and imaginary felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; there is leſs trouble here then in all the wayes of ſin; the wayes to Heaven, though they are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet are not unpleaſant, Prov. 3. 17. v. theſe <hi>are wayes of pleaſantneſs;</hi> though they are <hi>ſtrait</hi> yet are they not <hi>crooked;</hi> though labour they have in them, yet in them are not thoſe confuſions, diſtractions of thoughts, inward ſtorms, ſecret ſmarts, fears, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, labyrinths, intricated counſels, contradictory, circumſtances, unperformed promiſes, violations of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44106:188"/> health, accidental deaths, ſhames, diſgraces, ſcorns and contempts (with infinite the like things that might be named) as the wayes of ſin, Death and Hell have in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In labouring for <hi>Eternal good things</hi> labour <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly,</hi> this is St. <hi>Paul's</hi> practice. His directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have, 1 Cor. 15 laſt v. <hi>Therefore my beloved bretheren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know your labour is not in voin in the Lord,</hi> The Apoſtles direction in the former part of the verſe is backed with a good encouragement in the latter part of the Verſe; <hi>for as much as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> And as you have St. <hi>Paul's</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſo we have his practice, he did what himſelf taught; he was not like thoſe <hi>Lawyers</hi> againſt whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounceth a <hi>Woe,</hi> Luk. 11. 36. v. <hi>Woe unto you alſo, ye Lawyers, for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye your ſelves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers;</hi> that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here ſpeaketh againſt, was their rigid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious exaction of obedience to the whole Law of Ceremonies (which St. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>a yoak which we nor our Fathers were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15. 10. v.) and in the mean time they favoured themſelves, with eaſe and indulgence, not ſo this bleſſed Apoſtle, he was as one calleth him, <hi>inſatiabilem Dei cultorem,</hi> an unweariable ſervant of God. See 1 Cor. 15. 10. v. <hi>I laboured more aboundantly then they all,</hi> ſo 2 Cor. 11. 23. v. <hi>In labours more aboundant,</hi> he ſpent no time needleſly, had he done ſo, he could not have paſſed over ſo many Countries as he did to convert Souls and plant Churches. It is a note that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath of St. <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> was the moſt eminent of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:44106:188"/> all the Apoſtles, no Apoſtle out-ſtript <hi>Paul;</hi> Now Divines ask this queſtion, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be more eminent then the reſt of the Apoſtles, who ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw him only in a viſion, and no where elſe, yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> was more eminent than any other Apoſtle; and Divines give this reaſon, becauſe he was <hi>in labours more aboundant;</hi> he was more induſtrious and more laborious, and God bleſſed that labour of his with a further encreaſe of Grace then others had. Surely a Chriſtian may promiſe himſelf, that his aboundance of labour will be followed with aboundance of good things, and that both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> It is as true of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after <hi>Eternal good things</hi> as it is of <hi>Almes</hi> in <hi>Temporal things; He that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, and he that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 6. v. Word for word to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the latter part of the verſe it is thus, <hi>Qui ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat in benedictionibus in benedictionibus &amp; metet;</hi> he which ſoweth in benedictions or bleſſings ſhall reap in benedictions, he ſhall reap a plentiful Crop of bleſſings, not only upon Earth where this kind of ſeed is ſown, but a much more plentiful Crop in Heaven, he ſhall receive from God's hand not one kind of bleſſing only, but divers bleſſings of the right hand, and bleſſings of the left, <hi>Temporal</hi> bleſſings, <hi>Spiritual</hi> bleſſings, and <hi>Eternal</hi> bleſſings, bleſſings in this life, and bleſſings in the life to come. In like manner he that laboureth aboundantly for the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> he ſhall receive aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly thereof. Though no man ſhall be rewarded for his works, yet God will at leaſt meaſure out hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and bleſſedneſs to the ſons of men according to their works: Pſal. 36. 8. <hi>They ſhall be aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:44106:189"/> ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe: and thou ſhalt make them drink of the River of thy pleaſures.</hi> Let a Chriſtian be never ſo aboundant in his labours of this kind, yet there is goodneſs and mercy enough in God to anſwer all his labour; his mercy is <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. v. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope.</hi> The Clouds may commend the extent of his <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> and the Mountains may ſhadow out his <hi>right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
